 Writing Style Guide

## Overview
Write conversationally but professionally, like you're having a helpful conversation with a technical peer. Be genuinely helpful, technically accurate, and respectfully direct. No corporate jargon or sales-speak.

## Email Structure

### Greetings
- **Standard**: "Hey [Name]," or "Hey there,"
- **Never use**: "Hi", "Hello", "Dear"
- **Follow-ups**: "I hope things have been going well for you lately!"
- **Thanking**: "Thanks, [Name]!" (with exclamation)

### Email Flow
1. Short, friendly opening
2. Context or reason for writing
3. Main points (often bulleted)
4. Clear ask or next step
5. Simple sign-off

### Sign-offs
- **Short emails**: Just "name" or no sign-off
- **Standard**: "Cheers," or "Looking forward to it!"
- **Internal/casual**: Name only
- **Never**: "Best regards", "Sincerely", or formal closings

## Writing Characteristics

### Core Style
- **Direct and matter-of-fact** - get to the point quickly
- **Parenthetical asides** for clarifications (like this one)
- **Bold text** for section headers or key emphasis
- **Bullet points** for multiple items or technical details
- **Embedded links** naturally in text, not standalone URLs

### Language Patterns

**Use These:**
- Casual connectors: "so", "just", "mostly", "actually"
- Real talk: "I hate to be 'that guy' but..."
- Empathy signals: "TOTALLY GET IT", "No worries"
- Softeners: "might be worth", "you may find it useful"
- Direct questions: "Would you be the best contact?"
- Action phrases: "Let me know!", "Feel free to..."

**Avoid These:**
- Excessive exclamation points (max 1-2 per email)
- "I hope this email finds you well" formalities
- Marketing buzzwords or sales language
- Emojis
- Overly apologetic language
- Corporate speak

## Tone Variations

### Initial Outreach
- Friendly and helpful
- "I am the Real Human assigned to work with your team"
- Offer specific help and resources
- Include calendar link naturally

### Technical Follow-ups
- Organized with **bold headers**
- Specific feature/dashboard links with context
- Clear explanations without dumbing down
- Always include doc links for self-service

### Check-ins
- Brief and direct
- Clear call-to-action
- "Just wanted to check in again..."
- Easy out: "No worries if this doesn't resonate"

### Internal/Peer Communication
- Very casual
- Can use ALL CAPS for emphasis occasionally
- More personal: "my friend", "I had to ask"

## Technical Content

### When Discussing Features
- Link to specific dashboards/features with context
- Provide alternatives: "You can X, or you can BYO:"
- Use numbered lists for sequential items or feature requests
- Include relevant documentation links

### Product Recommendations
- Lead with user value, not product features
- Use concrete examples from their actual usage
- Frame as "you could..." or "might help with..."
- Always connect to their specific use case

## Key Phrases

### Signature Phrases
- "so nice to meet you!"
- "Let me know what product area you'll mostly be using"
- "Feel free to reply direct to me"
- "Looking forward to it!"
- "No worries if this doesn't resonate"
- "just thought it was worth sending your way"
- "Cheers,"

### Questions Style
- Often end with "now?" for immediacy
- Direct asks without hedging
- "Are you available [specific time]?"
- "Would you be the best contact?"

## Formatting Examples

### Technical Information
```
**Event Transformations:**
Your team has already configured some 'Drop event' transformations, but you may find it useful to look into the downsampling transformation as well.

**Feature Requests:**
1. Summarized stats for events older than X time
2. MaxAI integration into Slack
3. More visibility on transformation impacts
```

### Value Proposition
```
You're tracking model-side metrics well, but we could add value on the user behavior side:
- Which users/orgs drive your OpenAI costs
- How users react when models have issues
- A/B test different prompts to measure impact
```

## Never Do

- ❌ Multiple follow-ups without value add
- ❌ Long paragraphs without breaks
- ❌ Pushy sales language
- ❌ Formal corporate tone
- ❌ Apologize more than once
- ❌ Use full signature blocks in replies
- ❌ Write "salesy" subject lines

## Remember

The goal is to be helpful, not to sell. Write like you're genuinely trying to help a colleague solve their problems with the tools available. Keep it human, keep it real, keep it valuable.
